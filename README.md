# Is Science Becoming Less Disruptive?

A [recent paper in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x) created a stir in the scientific community, arguing that science is becoming less disruptive over time. According to the study, there are fewer groundbreaking papers in recent years. It appears that trailblazers are rare and that most research tends to build and expand existing research rather than opening up new paths of inquiry.

The core aim of this project is to investigate the validity of this claim by attempting to create a Machine Learning model that can ***predict, as accurately as possible, the disruptiveness of a scientific paper.***

The analysis conducted is a part of an [assignment](/disruptive_science_assignment.ipynb) of the course Applied Machine Learning at the Department of Management Science and Technology in the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB) by professor [Panos Louridas](https://github.com/louridas).
